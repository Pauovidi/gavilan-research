She earned her PhD in Advanced Chemistry at ICMM-CSIC (Spain) in 2017, specializing in colloidal synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for biomedicine under the supervision of M. P. Morales and L. Guti√©rrez. She then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the group of Nanomaterials for biomedical applications, leaded by Teresa Pellegrino. Dr. Gavil√°n gained expertise in magnetic hyperthermia, photothermal therapy, MRI, and drug delivery, including a research stay at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (USA).</p><p>Dr. Gavil√°n has authored over 30 publications published in prestigious journals such as Chemical Society Reviews, Nature Protocols, Small or ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces; including highly cited works on magnetic hyperthermia (&gt;350 citations), and holds two patents. She is Principal Investigator of national and European projects (AMULET, DREAM-Nano, AniMAG) and serves as working group leader and management committee member in the European COST Action NexMPI. She was also co-founded HyperCube, a start-up project developing magnetic nanocubes for nanomedicine, and is actively involved in training and mentoring young researchers.</p><p>She is engaged in teaching innovation projects, such as e-STEM, which aims to enhance STEM education through innovative methodologies and digital resources, with a focus on supporting women and pregnant students. She also contributes to the UNA EUROPA initiative, promoting academic collaboration and educational excellence.</p><p>Outside her research activities, Dr. Gavil√°n spends part of her leisure time engaged in cooking and climbing.</p><p><strong>CONTACT</strong></p><p><strong>Helena Gavil√°n Rubio</strong><br>Ram√≥n y Cajal Researcher, Universidad Complutense de Madrid<br>Department of Physical Chemistry<br>üìç Madrid, Spain<br>üìß hgavilan@ucm.es<br>üîó <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2071-628X\" target=\"_new\">ORCID</a> | <a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57191912898\" target=\"_new\">Scopus</a> | <a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/S-9663-2017\" target=\"_new\">Web of Science</a></p>",
