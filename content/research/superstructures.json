  "descriptionHtml": "<p>We study the template-free fabrication of reconfigurable superstructures from magnetic nanoparticles. Field-guided self-organization and dipolar coupling govern mesoscale order, enabling reversible transitions between architectures. The goal is to program magnetic response and topology without lithographic constraints.</p><p>By tuning size, shape and surface of the building blocks we access regimes where long-range interactions dominate, producing lattices and chains whose mechanical and magnetic properties can be modulated on demand. Preliminary findings outline design rules for robust, rewritable assemblies.</p>",
